				Thanks for downloading Dynamic Data ROMs!

                This demo rom is designed to help you write your own lore ROMs,
                enabling them to appear in the universe as random loot, vendor
                items, or from missions - you can use them anywhere that items
                can be spawned, dropped, or sold!

                To make your own data roms, just copy the &amp;DDR_itDemoROM; item
                into your own &lt;TranscendenceExtension&gt; or &lt;TranscendenceLibrary&gt;.

                Next, give it a new UNID, a new name, possibly edit the value/frequency/attributes
                as appropriate, and then change the text inside of the &lt;Text&gt;
                block to whatever you desire!

                ==Formatting help==

                [TEST] what does this do?
                
                "You can add pre-formatted dialogue like this simply by wrapping it in double quotes"

                \"But if you don't want them to format differently than the rest of the text,
                you can add a backslash before each double quote to display them like this instead.\"

                The game will ignore single newlines followed by more text, and will
                automatically word-wrap them to fit the text area. It will create a new
                paragraph area if you use a double-newline however.

                The text area will scroll if the text in the text field is long enough.

                Some special characters will need to be entered manually as special
                escaped sequencies. For example, an "&amp;" is entered as "&amp;amp;",
                while a "&lt;" is entered as "&amp;lt;" and a "&gt;" is entered as "&amp;gt;"
